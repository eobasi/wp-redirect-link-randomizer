Redirect Links Randomizer creates a random link out of a predetermined group of links. We specify in advance the urls to be put in a group you have created, and have Redirect Links Randomizer randomly draw one out to follow. With it you can easily manage multiple WhatsApp groups and stop sending traffic to a WhatsApp group when it has hit its group limit.

Redirect Links Randomizer is designed to randomly distribute traffics to a set of urls in a group and store hit count for each url.
